      <h1>Angular: Ecosystems</h1>
      <h2>The CLI</h2>
      <p class="lead">Interacting Solely w/ the keyboard and text, n o GUI</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most common approach is to use the
          <br>BASH - (Bourne Again Shell)</li>
        <li>Special installation instructions for getting BASH onto Windows machines</li>
        <li>Usually you find yourself following a common pattern
          <br>> [command] [options] [arguments]
          <ul>
            <li>Commands - the program you want to run</li>
            <li>Options - change how the program works when you run the command</li>
            <li>Arguments - the data you want to pass into the command when it runs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Usually there'll be a man page w/ usage instructions
          <br>> man (command)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Operating Systems and Virtual Machines</h2>
      <p class="lead">Special software program that acts like a brain for your computer</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It tells the hardware what to do, and how to act based on inputs and outputs, and the programs installed on your
          machine
        </li>

        <li>Hardware - all the physical things you can touch and hold</li>
        <li>Software - All the programs and instructions that tell your computer what to do</li>
        <li>The OS sits between the hardware and the software, managing resources and giving the user a chance to interact</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Virtual Machines</h3>
      <p class="lead">A software program that acts like a hardware interface for OS's</p>
      <p>The big benefit is that they allow you and your team to install the exact same configuration across all your computers
        and servers, so the code you write will be written in the same environment.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You instal the VM onto your computer</li>
        <li>Once installed your computer acts as the host machine, and each of the virtualOS is treated as a guest</li>
        <li>Guest OS's never touch the host - so you can configure each guest independently of your host machine</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Aith Angular, the 2 most common Virtual Machines are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>VirtualBox - allows you to install and run full OS images, it's like installing a whole new operating system, but
          there are some downsides:
          <ul>
            <li>Very large files</li>
            <li>Uses lots of memory</li>
            <li>Slow to boot</li>
            <li>Hard to share</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Vagrant - solves the issues above by providing
          <ul>
            <li>A common platform and API to help share virtual machines</li>
            <li>Vagrant Images - "Boxes"
              <ul>
                <li>Boot up fast (1 or 2 minutes)</li>
                <li>Uses less hard drive space and memory than virtual machines - by allowing you to build a custom machine in
                  layers, add the bits and pieces you need, and toss the rest</li>
                <li>This makes virtual boxes much easier to share, update, and work with everyday.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Servers and Databases</h2>
      <p class="lead">They're at the center of every Angular app</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Servers - are what sit on the backend of your Angular app, and usually wired into a network of some kind</li>
        <li>Servers must be reliable</li>
        <li>Go with a vendor that specializes in maintenance and upkeep of server hardware</li>
        <li>Some good options are
          <ul>
            <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
            <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
            <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
            <li>Digital Ocean</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Basically, the internet is just a bunch of publically available servers that are accessed through a web browser
          <ul>
            <li>It sends requests and resources to the backend</li>
            <li>Where the backend sends back data to the browser</li>
            <li>This data is usually stored in a database:
              <ul>
                <li>They're like filing cabinets for your data</li>
                <li>They make it easy to add and find entries based on keywords and search terms</li>
                <li>There are 2 types of databases
                  <ul>
                    <li>SQL - Structured Query Language - Acts as a common interface for finding and filtering records in a database
                      - great for large data sets and complex relationshhips because the data is stored in tables - examples
                      - MySQL and PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>NoSQL - Great for data sets with nested properties - or data that's being stored temporarily because
                      the data can easily be passed back and forth between the front end and the back end - examples - CouchDB
                      and Redis</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Version Control</h2>
      <p class="lead">Aka: "Revision Control" or "Source Controll" are ways of managing changes in the code of your project across all the
        members of your team.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What was changed?</li>
        <li>Who changed it?</li>
        <li>How to undo it</li>
        <li>How to unify the changes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Most Use Git</h3>
      <p class="lead">A distributed version control system </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Very robust meaning everybody has a full copy of the history of all the changes to the code base</li>
        <li>Making it very easy to restore is something happens to the original</li>
        <li>Repo - an entire code base in version controll</li>
        <li>Repos have branches - Independent versions of the code base</li>
        <li>All branches are stored in the same repo</li>
        <li>You make a new Independent copy of a Repo by cloning it, that may or may not stay insync w/ the original repo</li>
        <li>Commits - are a set of changes across any # of files, these changes get recorded in the changelog of the repo</li>
        <li>A conflict happens when there are 2 or more changes to the repo that can't be automatically figured out, and you
          have to manually fix and figure it out</li>
        <li>You reconcile things by merging the different versions</li>
        <li>Pull - when you download the latest version from a remote repo</li>
        <li>Push - when you upload your version to a remote repo</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Code Editors</h2>
      <p class="lead">Allow you to edit plain text files</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recommend Visual Studio Code and works well w/ Angular projects</li>
        <li>There are also IDE's - Integrated Development environments
          <ul>
            <li>very robust and includes everything you might need to write, test, run your application - examples - Webstorm
              and Visual Studio (DIFFERENT FROM VS CODE)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
      <p class="lead">Angualr was built from the ground up for Testing and Debugging</p>
      <h3>Most common tests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Code linting - checking code for readability, consistency, and syntax
          <br>The never run your code, they just read over every line in a file and checks them against rules</li>
        <li>Unit testing - checking small chunks of code to make sure they work as expected, they make it clear as to what your
          code is meant to do, and lowers the risk of new code causing errors, they are usually:
          <ul>
            <li>Functions</li>
            <li>Objects</li>
            <li>Methods</li>
          </ul>
          Angular uses Jasmine framework w/ the Karma task runner
        </li>
        <li>End-to-end testing - "Integration tests" - used for testing user interaction - makes sure the UI is meant to work
          the way it's supposed to by pretending to be an end user
          <ul>
            <li>Angular uses the Protractor Framework for end-to-end testing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Debuggin</h3>
      <p class="lead">Almost always happens in the browser, in some sort of dev tool that let's you see reports of the errors</p>
      <p>Angular does a great job of telling you what's wrong</p>
      <h2>Building and Deploying Code</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You want to use Google's official tool
          <strong>ng</strong>
        </li>
        <li>First you must have
          <strong>npm</strong> to install it</li>
        <li>then you can run
          <code>$ npm install -g @angular/cli</code> to install the angular CLI tool globally</li>
        <li>Compile the build/src code with
          <br>
          <code>$ ng build --prod</code>
          <br> The angular CLI tool has many commands to start and maintain an Angular project
          <br>Look at the documentation for a full list of he options available.
        </li>
        <li>You can also use other tools like
          <ul>
            <li>Gulp</li>
            <li>Grunt</li>
            <li>Yarn</li>
            <li>Webpack</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deploying Code</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosted Platforms</li>
        <li>SSH</li>
        <li>Continuous Integration</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment</h2>
      <p class="lead">Involved in a workflow that reduces risk and improve code quality</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CI - Process of committing small chunks of code to a shared repository several times a day
          <ul>
            <li>Each commit is tested for bugs using the automated testing process</li>
            <li>If there's a bug it's easy to rewind to a functional state</li>
          </ul>
          Common Platforms are: (they all build and test code in an automated way) - Automation gives you confidence!
          <ul>
            <li>Travis CI</li>
            <li>Codeship</li>
            <li>Jenkins</li>
            <li>Circle CI</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>CD(elivery) - the confidence to deliver, keeping your code in a state of readyness that can be pushed to production
          at any time - while you still get to choose when you push code into production</li>
        <li>CD(eployment) - automates the deployment process - every new change, no matter how small is pushed right to production
          as soon as it passes the test suite - while it takes a way some control, it also removes a step from the build
          deploy process so you can focus on building new features for your app</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Complementary Frameworks</h2>
      <p class="lead">Angular is a client-side framework that you use to build single page apps.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A client is any device on a network used by an end user</li>
        <li>SPA - are browser based apps that give users a very fluid experience, often mimicking the look and feel of native
          applications installed on a users' device</li>
        <li>Angular is a very powerful frame work that you can use to build great apps! But is also used with
          <ul>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>Ionic - prebuilt UI for mobile apps</li>
            <li>Foundation</li>
            <li>Pure</li>
            <li>ng-bootstrap</li>
          </ul>
          These give you prebuilt UI's to use in our apps
        </li>
        <li>You can also pair Angular w/ serverside frameworks such as:
          <ul>
            <li>ASP.net</li>
            <li>Laravel</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Servers - are what sit on the backend of your application, they connect clients on a network, listening for a request,
          sending resources to the client - server side frameworks resemble the experience of a normal website, but the benefits
          are
          <ul>
            <li>Faster load times</li>
            <li>Simpler integration w/ databases</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Angular is a modular framework w/ tons of components and for this we use Dependency Managers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>npm</li>
        <li>yarn</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <p class="lead">Management of a project is just as important as its creation</p>
      <p>Gihub and Bitbucket are great places to start managing your projects, they allow you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Issue Tracking - track any kind of task you want, it's like a to-do list for the team</li>
        <li>Wikis - lets you write long form content about your project and processes, documentation</li>
        <li>Pull Requests - Let's you discuss and review code changes before they're merged into a branch, giving you an extra
          layer of confidence before committing changes to the repository</li>
        <li>JIRA(manage multiple projects all from one place) and Confluence(Wikis, to deal w/ multiple teams) are both alternatives
          to issue tracking and wikis
          <br>Then there are other things to help
          <ul>
            <li>Trello</li>
            <li>Basecamp</li>
            <li>Asana</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
