      <h1>Craft Your Brand Promise</h1>
      <h2>Examine</h2>

            <li>Customer Desires</li>
            <li>Competitor Strenths</li>
            <li>Your Strengths</li>

      <h2>Ladder</h2>
      <p>Keep upping the stakes on what the benefit to the customer is. Establish tiers you release over time with buy-in and being established.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ladder</strong> - Prevents overstepping - like, they can't believe it, or it doesn't make sense.</li>
        <li>It also helps you to see where you're going</li>
        <li><strong>Profit Margin</strong> - The large the emotional benefit, the more customers are willing to pay. So slow roll it.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Moat</strong> - the higher you are on the ladder, the harder it is for others to copy.</li>
        <li><strong>Headroom to Grow</strong> - The higher you are on the ladder, the more you can grow laterally.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Create a Benefits Ladder</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is that functional benefit your customer will enjoy?</li>
        <li>How is their day better? What does it enable, at an emotional level?</li>
        <li>How is their life better? What do they enjoy because of you?</li>
