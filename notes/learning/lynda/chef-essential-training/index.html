        <h1>Chef - Essential Training</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h2>Welcome</h2>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to Chef Essentials. My name is Robin Beck. I'm the lead instructor for Chef's global training partner, TechnoTrainer, and I couldn't be happier to facilitate your next steps with Chef. This intermediate-level class will focus on more advanced cookbook deployment, as we build a practical LAMP stack for Chef. This means we'll focus on standing up a Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP stack to serve a basic web application.</p>

        <p>In the first chapter of this course, we're going to focus on directly configuring a virtual machine. By applying cookbook code directly to this virtual machine, we'll get a hands-on refresher on what Chef resources are, how the Chef client works, and how to organize recipes with cookbooks. In the second chapter, we'll explore community cookbook code by utilizing the Chef Supermarket and discussing wrapper cookbook patterns. The third chapter will focus on actually adding a web application.</p>

        <p>We'll build a practical cookbook that deploys a PHP application on top of our LAMP stack cookbook. In the last chapter, we'll give you an introduction to Test Kitchen to speed up your deployments and teach you how to automate the testing process. I'm so excited to get started, so let's jump in.</p>

        <h3>What You Should Know</h3>

        <p>>Before we jump in, I wanted to mention what I expect you to know coming into this class so that you can get the most out of what we're going to cover. This is an intermediate-level course. I'm going to attempt to break down all the core concepts we'll cover as we progress through the content. This course does assume some familiarity with programming principles, scripting, and command-line editing. I'll assume that you know how to get around the Bash shell. I'll be moving into and out of directories, copying folders around, and also renaming files and editing them.</p>
        
        <p>If you're not familiar with Bash shell scripting, then I recommend the course by Scott Simpson, Learning Bash Scripting. I'll also expect you to understand the basics of configuration management and DevOps principles. In this class, we're going to be describing our infrastructure as code, and so I'll hope that you understand what this process involves. If not, go ahead and check out DevOps Foundations by Ernest Mueller and James Wickett, and visit chef.io to get started learning about configuration management and where Chef fits into the big picture.</p>
        
        <p>I'll also expect that you understand how to edit files using a command-line interface. This will involve using a tool like Vim, Emacs, or nano. Later on in the course, I'll be editing files with Sublime Text, but you're welcome to use an equivalent editor like Atom or Visual Studio Code. If you're getting started with these tools, feel free to use VimTutor. VimTutor is built into Vim and you can get started immediately if you install the package.</p>
        
        <p>Learning Sublime Text 3 is a great course by Kevin Yank if you've never used a text editor. In addition to this, I'm going to assume some basic familiarity with Chef. If you're new to the ecosystem, feel free to visit my introductory course, Learning Chef. You can also visit learn.chef.io for some online interactive tutorials that'll familiarize you with the basics. It's also great to be familiar with Basic Ruby and object-oriented programming techniques.</p>
        
        <p>However, understand that you do not need to know Ruby to get started with Chef. As you progress through Chef more deeply though, learning Ruby becomes a huge asset. If you're interested in upping your skills, check out Ruby Essential Training by Kevin Skoglund or visit tryruby.org. Finally, this class is going to focus on a LAMP stack deployment. So I will expect you to know what these components are used for. For this purpose, you can check out Wikipedia's LAMP stack page.</p>
        
        <p>Also, there's a great LAMP stack tutorial on ibm.com that can teach you about what goes into a typical LAMP stack deployment.</p>
