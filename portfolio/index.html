        <h1>Bryan's Bio</h1>
        <p>Bryan Cee was born and raised in Fox hill, the oldest village in Nassau Bahamas. Not being born to a musical family he stood apart because music would become the essence of his entire being.</p>
        <p>Although he was quite eclectic, Bryan was inspired by the music of Bob Marley, Beres Hammond, Bjork, Enya Tony McKay, and Ray Charles.</p>
        <p>Originally a poet, Bryan Cee portrayed a different aspect to his personality, through his introspective and conscious lyrics.</p>
        <p>By being exposed to Classical music from a very young age, he grew fond of the piano and began his studies at 17. From there he received a Bachelors degree in music studies from St. Johns University, majoring in Piano, Organ, and Tuba.</p>
        <p>He then furthered his studies by attaining a masters in piano at McNally Smith college of music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cee has performed both locally in the Bahamas and abroad on several festivals including the Global Battle of the Bands where he shared the stage with Ira Storr and K.B. In 2012 Bryan Cee represented the Bahamas in Atlanta's annual Caribbean festival where they also featured Bunji Garland, Damarco, and Kerwin Du Bois.</p>
        <p>in 2014 he relocated back to Minnesota where he has been performing with his new band called the Wibesmen. The group has played extensively since then doing numerous festivals including Global market festival, Secret Circus,</p>
        <p>Winter Carnival,and River front prototype festival. In 2015 the Wibesmen backed and opened for Jamaican reggae artist Chuck Fender during the Warning tour.</p>
        <p>By 2016 Bryan Cee completed his first album called "The Wibe Of life" which included his first single "Long Lost Brother" which was released with a music Video in late 2012.</p>
        <p>He insists that his only Goal in life is to bring Conscious Encouragement for Everyone, through his enlightening tales and uplifting music!</p>
